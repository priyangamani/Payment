# About
Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a FrontEnd/Mobile Engineer with more than 9 years of experience, currently working with ðŸ“š Micro-frontends, Typescript, Node, React & Redux, and tests (E2E, integration and unit).

I've done all sorts of cool stuff throughout those years and some of them are listed below. Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
